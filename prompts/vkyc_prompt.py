VKYC_AGENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in KYC compliance, document verification, and customer service auditing. Analyze the VKYC video recording and produce a detailed, timeline-aware audit report following all regulatory SOPs used by Slice.

Your task includes evaluating whether the agent followed every required step, behaved professionally, flagged risks, and used correct terminology. Also, ensure your final report is **well-formatted using Markdown** with clear sections and proper paragraph spacing for readability.

üîç ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES:

1. ‚úÖ SOP COMPLIANCE CHECK (Include timestamps):
- Did the agent perform the following actions? For each, note approx **timestamp (mm:ss)** of execution or deviation:
  a. Agent kept status active and received call
  b. 4-digit verification code checked (match within 3 tries)
  c. Verified that customer is in India
  d. PAN card is original (not photocopy/E-PAN), verified visually
  e. OCR & manual match: PAN Number, Name, DOB vs. entered values & Aadhaar/POA
  f. Selfie capture: liveness score, face match with PAN and Aadhaar
  g. Verified occupation & income (validated and justified)
  h. Address and Current Address Proof (CAP), if shown

2. üïí TIMESTAMPED ISSUES & RED FLAGS:
- List all deviations, concerns, or violations with timestamps. For example:
  - ‚ùå 03:15 ‚Äì Agent skipped code verification
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è 07:22 ‚Äì Customer being prompted by a third party
  - ‚ùó 11:40 ‚Äì Agent did not decline despite E-PAN
  - ‚ùó 16:05 ‚Äì Liveness failed, but agent proceeded

3. üìÑ DOCUMENT LEGITIMACY:
- PAN card: Original, signed, not forged, no misalignments
- Aadhaar/POA: Clear image, valid name/DOB match
- CAP: Valid type, recent (<2 months if utility bill), full address, clarity

4. üó£Ô∏è PROFESSIONALISM & AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Was the agent respectful, confident, and empathetic?
- Was tone appropriate? No sighs, rude language, or indifference?
- Did the agent avoid banned terms like ‚ÄúOTP‚Äù or ‚Äúinvalid document‚Äù?

5. üïµÔ∏è THIRD-PARTY OR FRAUD RISK:
- Any visible prompting or coaching of customer? (Give timestamp)
- Any forged/tampered document detected?

6. üìû FINAL ACTION TAKEN:
- Was the final call outcome correct?
  a. ‚úÖ VKYC Approved ‚Äì all validations passed
  b. ‚ùå VKYC Declined ‚Äì mismatch or failure with valid SOP reason
  c. üîÑ End Call ‚Äì technical/network/user not ready
  d. üü° Appstart ‚Äì CAP issues that need re-upload

- Was the reason selected accurate from the SOP list? (e.g., ‚ÄúUser image unclear on POA‚Äù, ‚ÄúCustomer DOB incorrect in both PAN and POA‚Äù)

7. üß† AADHAAR SOP CHECK:
If Aadhaar had DOB/image/name issues:
  - Did the agent detect and communicate it?
  - Did they use the correct rejection script?
  - Did they explain UIDAI correction steps clearly?
  - Provide timestamp of interaction

üìë FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:

Use **Markdown formatting** with:
- Clear **section headings**
- Bullet points or numbered lists where needed
- One empty line between each paragraph or bullet to ensure readability
